                <p>Baltimore is not just only talented and experienced in a diverse sound set, but in the visual arts as well. A city built on creativity where creative expression is a method of escape for many, there are a plethora of local artists across the visual arts disciplines that have made a name for themselves.</p>
                <p>A tidbit of information that adds to the importance of arts is that itâ€™s reinforced within the Baltimore City Public School System. Across the city, there are many schools dedicated to the arts specifically, for example, Baltimore Design School and Baltimore School for the Arts, the top two arts high schools in the city where students can flex and expand their knowledge in their respective creative disciplines.</p>

                <p>Within the city, there are various creative spaces for locals and visiting residents to use and see. One main area in mind is The Station North Arts District, where all mentioned places can be found.</p>

                    <figcaption>The Station North-Arts District is an area in Baltimore city full of art and wonder. This area is full of art workspaces, murals on almost every empty wall, and there are open studios & galleries not just for visual art but also places for poetry slams, small concerts, and more. Full of local shops, mostly Black or queer owned, the Arts District is a place you can go and be amazed no matter what corner you turn. <br>
                    Visit over the summer and you'll get to experience all of the wonderful art/culture-related festivals hosted in the district such as Pride, Trans Pride Parade, and ArtScape: a festival that promotes art and culture.

                    <figcaption>Graffiti Alley. A place where graffiti, something that is commonly frowned upon, is welcomed with open arms. Artists come and draw whatever their heart desires at their leisure, so the alley never looks the same for too long. Attached is the Graffiti Warehouse, which is full of amazing art pieces from artists around the city.</figcaption>
