            <p>A city normally so full of life and bliss, there’s a culture that pours out and inspires the world. Baltimore is the home of ‘Baltimore club,’ a subgenre of breakbeat and house music which originated from Chicago in the 70s. Baltimore club music made such a huge impact on the city that it became widespread throughout the East Coast. This sparked a revolution for many other large cities to create their own sounds, inspired by many of the talented Baltimore DJs. Truly, music has been a way for Baltimore to bring people together from far and wide.</p>
